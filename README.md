# 📦 Raspberry Pi V2G

This is the Raspberry Pi **V2G repository README** in which we will explain all the parts of the code **we know**.
For any sort of code should be a description written down here so that other programmers can easily read and understand here what the code does, no matter there skill level.


## 🌟 Highlights

- First start of the **README** file for better understanding
- Some code is written by previous semester we'll do our best to explain it as good as possible but there could be some mistakes.
